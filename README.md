# warriorsGameCounter
Used existing knowledge of React to create a scoreboard where a user is able to change the score of the current game with the use of buttons. Also incorporated a time that re-renders the state of the date component to show current time with seconds. Inspired by watching the Warriors vs. Blazers Game 4.
